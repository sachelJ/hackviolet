            <h2>Why Salary Negotiation Is Important</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Studies have proven that women rarely speak up when compared to men in salary discussions. Negotiating with employers may be an uncomfortable situation and it is actually in human nature for woman to no push as hard as men do for themselves. However, the women who do advocate for themselves are more than twice as likely to receive raises than women who do not. By not speaking up, women are being pushed to the lower end of the pay-gap in technological jobs.   </li>
